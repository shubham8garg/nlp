<h1>Text Classification</h1>
<p>
    In this post, we will check the text classification problem in NLP

    Some common examples of text classification:
    1. Marking emails as spam/non-spam 
    2. Classifying the comments on a post as 1/2/3/4/5
    and many more.... 

    So, we can divide the text classification task into two sub-categories, which are:
    1. Binary Text Classification
    2. Multi-class text classification
